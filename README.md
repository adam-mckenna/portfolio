# Adam McKenna Portfolio

## Who am I?

I’m a full-stack developer with a passion for **user experience**, **accessibility** and **service design**.

Like many developers, my life coding **started about 10 years ago** building basic PHP websites with WordPress. Then I discovered how **great JavaScript is**. I’ve been lucky enough to write JavaScript for a **[large Germany agency](https://www.merkle.com/dach/en)**, a **[small English agency](https://www.binaryvision.com/)**, the **[UK government](https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/)** and a **[debt-support charity](https://moneyadvicetrust.org/)**. 

These days, after a sabbatical to travel the world, I’m working mostly with frontend stuff with a real focus on creating **highly usable and accessible applications** with a focus on **slick service design**. **[React](https://react.dev/)** is my forte, but I’m also working with other technologies too. I also work on  backend stuff as needed.  

Outside of work, I’m a **[keen runner](https://www.instagram.com/adamcantrun)**, the **household chef** and a bit of a **coffee snob**. I’ve always got a **[few books on the go](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62146817-adam-mckenna)**, too. 

## This website.

This website is a basic portfolio to showcase my experience and a few projects I've worked on. It's built with **[Astro](https://astro.build/)**, **[React](https://react.dev/)** and [**Tailwind**](https://tailwindcss.com/), and deployed with **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**. 

I'm drawn inspiration heavily from other great developers and designers for the user interface. I like it. I hope you do too.
